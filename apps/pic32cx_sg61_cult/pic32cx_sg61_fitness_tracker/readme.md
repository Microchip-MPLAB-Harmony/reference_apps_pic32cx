## Description:
> The application demonstrates a solution based on Microchip products for the health care industry
  and wearable products. The application displays heart rate readings on a display and posts this Heart Rate data to Microchip Bluetooth Data (MBD)
  android mobile application via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

> The Mikro Elektronika Heart Rate 9 click board is used to read the heart pulse.
  Mikroelektronika OLED C Click display is used for displaying the heart rate.
  RNBD451PE Add On Board using the RNBD451 Bluetooth module is used to send the heart rate data over BLE.

> The Heart Rate 9 click introduces Microchip's proprietary method of measuring multiple
  signals in a body using pseudorandom binary sequence generation and phase division multiplexing
  This algorithm for processing data from the sensor and it can send data for 3 different diodes
  (green, ir, red) who give out a diagram of the heartbeat and its frequency per minute.

> The host MCU PIC32CX SG61 is interfaced with the Heart Rate 9 click over the USART interface, the RNBD451PE Bluetooth module over UART and the OLED C click over SPI Interface.

## Programming hex file:
The prebuilt hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file, 
	located into the hex folder in the dowloaded zip file (pic32cx_sg61_fitness_tracker/hex/pic32cx_sg61_cult.X.production.hex).
- Select Device has "PIC32CX1025SG61128"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (pic32cx_sg61_fitness_tracker/firmware/pic32cx_sg61_cult.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "Make and Program Device" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
<span style="color:blue"> *Before proceeding, install the Microchip Bluetooth Data app on a Smartphone.* </span>
- Enable Bluetooth and location from Smartphone settings
- Perform reset by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable of PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen1.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

- After power-up, the application displays the Microchip logo on the OLED C click board and initializes the bluetooth module if necessary, and the heart rate sensor.
- The two LEDs (LED1 and LED2) on the PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board will toggle untill initialization finishes
- After successful initialization of the heart rate sensor, two integrated LEDs on the Heart Rate 9 click lights up.
- On the OLEC C display a message is shown that the application is initializing
- After the application initializes, a message to put the finger on the sensor and press the SW2 swith is shown
- **LED0** on the PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board will shitch **OFF**
- **LED1** on the PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board will shitch **ON**

- Now, scan for Bluetooth devices by tapping START SCAN option on the MBD APP.
- The RNBD451PE device should appear as **MCHP_PIC32CX_SG16_HR** in the list of Bluetooth devices.

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen2.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

- Stop the scan and connect the **MCHP BLE device** by clicking on **MCHP_PIC32CX_SG16_HR**.
	This will establish a connection between the MBD BLE application and the RNBD451PE BLE device.

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen3.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen4.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

- Once BLE device is connected, the application shows the different services screen. Scrolll down and tap on the **Heart Rate Service**, it will redirect to **Sensor Location** screen.

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen5.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen6.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen6.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen7.png" width="207" height="450" align="middle">


- Place and keep your finger on Pulse Detection Indicator on the heart rate 9 click sensor as shown in the figure below.
- Observe the red LED in the middle of the heart lits shortly at short intervals of time. This would be the indication the sensor is corectly reading the pulse.

<img src="images/finger_placement.png" width="585" height="156" align="middle">

- Press on SW2 to read the sensor.
- **LED0** on the PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board will shitch **ON**
- **LED1** on the PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board will shitch **OFF**
- Wait till the **LED0** on PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board goes **OFF** and **LED1** goes **ON**. 
- The user can more reads by clicking SW2 without removing the finger from the sensor.
  **Note**: Make sure smartphone screens are not turned off and don't switch to any other App(s) on your smartphone.
- The heart rate value (in bpm - beats per minute) should be displayed on the **Sensor Location** screen as shown in the image below. 

<img src="images/mbd_appscreen8.png" width="225" height="450" align="middle">

- Also, the same heart rate value should be displayed on the OLED C display.

<img src="images/result_screen.png" width="206" height="197" align="middle">

### Running the Demo without BLE:
#### Note: To test the demo without BLE, disconnect the RNBD from EXT 2 connector of the PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board.
- Follow the same steps mentioned above, into the "Running the Demo" section, skipping the steps that are mentioning the Phone Bluetooth Application.


## Comments:
- Place your index finger gently on the heart rate 9 click sensor, don't push or put pressure on the sensor (the heart rate values may not be accurate)
- Make sure the smartphone screen is not turned off when reading Heart Rate Sensor data using the MBD smartphone APP and also, don't switch to any other smartphone App(s)
